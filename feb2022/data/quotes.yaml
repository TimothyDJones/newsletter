    While friendship has been by far the chief source of my happiness, acquaintance or general society has always meant little to me, and I cannot quite understand why a man should wish to know more people than he can make real friends of. –C. S. Lewis, [_Surprised by Joy_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Surprised_by_Joy.html?id=9hWKm2sFV2gC)

    The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all the categories of scientific method. Where they come from, no one knows. A person is sitting somewhere, minding his own business, and suddenly - flash! - he understands something he didn't understand before. Until it's tested the hypothesis isn't truth.
