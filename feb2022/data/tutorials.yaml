But how do they actually work? Perhaps I found this article so intriguing, because my introduction to professional development world was working on the venerable [Procomm Plus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datastorm_Technologies) software. Nevertheless, everyone can benefit from a basic understanding of how they work and this article does a great job, including copious examples of Rust code to demonstrate the concepts.
