    How do you optimize for happiness and productivity of technical staff in your organization? And are happiness and productivity correlated well?

Recent research shows that whiteboard interviews provide little in the way of assessment of technical skill and job fit and, instead, mostly measures the candidate's anxiety.

    Authenticity is the fundamental value of the millennial generation (or so I'm told). The technology industry is going through the growing pains of transition from one dominated by Baby Boomers and Gen X to Millennials and one of the latest fronts appears to be with respect to disclosure about one's own shortcomings. This article and the others cited in it show how development changes so quickly that even the most skilled have difficulty keeping up and that perhaps everyone needs to extend some mercy and grace to others instead of questioning their motives or, even worse, fundamental abilities. The better choice is to come along side and provide help and support.

In this essay, Kent Beck, pioneer of ["extreme programming"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), explains how personal accountability is fundamental to successful development work. In particular, he explores how the day-to-day tools, such as estimates (when used properly!), TDD and unit tests, and continuous integration, that we use are visible ways of demonstrating accountability to our teammates and stakeholders.
