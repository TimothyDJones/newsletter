## Quotable Quotes

While friendship has been by far the chief source of my happiness, acquaintance or general society has always meant little to me, and I cannot quite understand why a man should wish to know more people than he can make real friends of. –C. S. Lewis, [_Surprised by Joy_](https://books.google.com/books/about/Surprised_by_Joy.html?id=9hWKm2sFV2gC)

Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify! –Henry David Thoreau

Thinking doesn't guarantee that we won't make mistakes. But not thinking guarantees that we will. –Leslie Lamport, ["Why We Should Build Software Like We Build Houses"](https://www.wired.com/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/)

The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all the categories of scientific method. Where they come from, no one knows. A person is sitting somewhere, minding his own business, and suddenly - flash! - he understands something he didn’t understand before. Until it’s tested the hypothesis isn’t truth. For the tests aren’t its source. Its source is somewhere else. –Robert Pirsig, [_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](https://books.google.com/books?id=gx2ev_vwGKAC) (1974)

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system. –Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin, [_Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design_](https://books.google.com/books?id=uGE1DwAAQBAJ)

And friendship had other charms to captivate my heart. We could talk and laugh together and exchange small acts of kindness. We could join in the pleasure that books can give. We could be grave or gay together. If we sometimes disagreed, it was without spite, as a man might differ with himself, and the rare occasions of dispute were the very spice to season our usual accord. Each of us had something to learn from the others and something to teach in return. If any were away, we missed them with regret and gladly welcomed them when they came home. Such things as these are heartfelt tokens of affection between friends. They are the signs to be read on the face and in the eyes, spoken by the tongue and displayed in countless acts of kindness. They can kindle a blaze to melt our hearts and weld them into one. –St. Augustine, [_Confessions_](https://books.google.com/books?id=cffhm3jIMRoC) [(translated by R. S. Pine-Coffin)](https://books.google.com/books?id=cffhm3jIMRoC)

The one thing that does not abide by majority rule is a person's conscience. –Harper Lee, _To Kill A Mockingbird_

## Software Development Process and Methodology

#### Article: Complexity is killing software developers

One of the open secrets in the development world is the exponential growth of complexity of applications, platforms, and systems. In most cases, it is difficult, if not almost impossible, for programmers to have a strong understanding of their systems’ architectures. This article claims that the rise of APIs (cloud, serverless, etc.) has pushed teams toward excessive “accidental” complexity. Likewise, large organizations make communication more challenging. The basic upshot of the article is that providers of services need to have more empathy for their consumers, whether they are internal or external to allow simplification at as many levels as possible.
[https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html)

#### Article: Why Agile rarely works in the Enterprise

Today, agile development methods are the norm in most organizations. No one wants to say that their team isn’t agile! However, in large organizations, agile (often the “big A” agile sold by many consultancies) efforts fall far short of their goals and frequently end up as “waterfall with stand ups”. This article looks at several of the pitfalls and some concrete suggestions for how to fix these problems. How many of these do you recognize in your own organization or team?
[https://medium.com/@gramr/why-agile-rarely-works-in-the-enterprise-816561515549](https://medium.com/@gramr/why-agile-rarely-works-in-the-enterprise-816561515549)

#### Article: Great engineering teams focus on milestones instead of projects

Why do some teams just seem to perform better than others? This author says that teams that emphasize accomplishing clear, well-defined milestones that provide some specific business value. This allows the team to adapt more easily and for the team to break the project into more manageable "chunks" of work. In turn, both the project team and customers can see measurable progress toward the larger goal.
[https://www.rubick.com/milestones-not-projects/](https://www.rubick.com/milestones-not-projects/)

#### Article: Don’t start with microservices – monoliths are your friend

Doubtless, this article is destined to inspire controversy. Nevertheless, the author makes several strong points in favor of introducing microservices later in the lifecycle of your project, after you’ve stabilized the overall architecture and identified the places where they make sense. To be sure, he is not anti-microservices; instead, he simply advocates taking a balanced approach to how they are used.
[https://arnoldgalovics.com/microservices-in-production/](https://arnoldgalovics.com/microservices-in-production/)

#### Article: Agile is Dead, McKinsey Just Killed It

In a _very_ similar vein to the article above, this article shows how the adoption of “enterprise agile”, especially as provided by consultancies, such as McKinsey in this case, have essentially left the whole agile concept often without meaning. The article discusses how McKinsey touts their offering of overarching management of the agile process and organization, which is the antithesis of principles of the Agile Manifesto.

#### Article: Writing Maintainable Code Is a Communication Skill

You may remember early in your career that you focused on delivering your application above all else. As you gained experience, you started to understand that so much else matters, including maintainability. This author explains that maintainability is primarily the skill of communicating both your intent and any trade-offs or special constraints that you had to take into account.
[https://max.engineer/maintainable-code](https://max.engineer/maintainable-code)

#### Article: Tasking developers with creating detailed estimates is a waste of time/money

Many of you have probably heard of the so-called [#NoEstimates “movement”](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23noestimates+movement&t=h_&ia=web) in the software development milieu. This article, however, is not against estimates, but rather against having developers spend time trying to do **detailed** estimation on work that inevitably requires much additional discovery to complete successfully. The author emphasizes that estimates should be based on accurate historical data for similar efforts (size, complexity, technology, team, etc.) and, most importantly, that the overall estimate is **not** a definitive completion date for the project.
[https://iism.org/article/is-tasking-developers-with-creating-detailed-estimates-a-waste-of-company-money-42](https://iism.org/article/is-tasking-developers-with-creating-detailed-estimates-a-waste-of-company-money-42)

#### Article: In Defense of Clean Code: 100+ pieces of timeless advice from Uncle Bob

[Robert C. “Uncle Bob” Martin](https://blog.cleancoder.com/) is legendary in the software development methodology world. Recently, he has been roundly criticized from many quarters. I don’t know if the accusations made against him are founded or not, but many of the attacks seem quite _ad hominem_ and risk reaching the level of metaphorically throwing the baby out with the bath water. This article reminds us of many of the ideas that he has popularized (whether he originated them or not), which are still good practice and advice, based on widespread experience.
[https://dzone.com/articles/in-defense-of-clean-code-100-pieces-of-timeless-ad](https://dzone.com/articles/in-defense-of-clean-code-100-pieces-of-timeless-ad)

#### Article: Why we always end up with waterfall even with Scrum/Agile

Today, most organizations use some type of agile methodology (Scrum, XP, etc.) for their development process. However, as probably all of us have observed, we frequently fall back into using waterfall practices despite how much we try to follow our chosen process. Why is that? This author explains that developing applications is not only about process and methodology, but about many other factors beyond the control of the team, each of which “conspires” to move us back toward what we feel comfortable with. Rather than let this frustrate us, we need to recognize the value gained from the parts of the new methodology that we have adopted and incrementally work toward further improvements, whether those improvements fit the prescribed definition or not.

#### Article: The Importance of Humility in Software Development

When you consider “soft skills” in programming, which do you think are the most important? Most people probably don’t put humility on their list, but this author says that it’s a critical trait for successful developers, because programming is about solving problems and one needs to recognize his/her own limits of knowledge and experience. He references no less figure than [Edsger Dijkstra](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/) in making his case.
[http://humbletoolsmith.com/2020/08/10/the-importance-of-humility-in-software-development/](http://humbletoolsmith.com/2020/08/10/the-importance-of-humility-in-software-development/)

#### Article: Estimates Are Useful, Just Ditch the Numbers

Recently, there was a [_very_](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1437635319159996416) [disturbing exchange on Twitter](https://twitter.com/duarte_vasco/status/1437635319159996416) about the philosophy of the [#NoEstimates](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/noestimates-debate-unbiased-look-origins-arguments-thought-leaders-behind-movement) perspective. I think that a more measured, pragmatic approach to estimation that balances the business need for commitment and delivery planning with flexibility that accounts for unknowns and changes on the development side is far more productive. This author outlines just such a conceptual framework in this article. As we all know, [_plans_ are worthless, but _planning_ is everything](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/).

#### Article: The Worst Question You Can Ask a Software Developer
If you’re a programmer or tester, what is the _one_ question that you _least_ like to hear? Probably most of you answered: “When will you be done?” This author explains why this question, whether it comes from business customers, the project manager, or your boss, is counterproductive and offers a simple alternative: “What is left to be done?” This question helps management provide some context to others about progress and, when they must (and they almost always must at some point!) give a reasonable estimate about when the work will be done, along with appropriate caveats.
[https://betterprogramming.pub/the-worst-question-you-can-ask-a-software-developer-ddbcd5956eb4](https://betterprogramming.pub/the-worst-question-you-can-ask-a-software-developer-ddbcd5956eb4)

#### Article: Driving engineers to an arbitrary date is a value destroying mistake
You have likely been involved in a project that had some arbitrary delivery/completion date set. What was the result? In most cases, it doesn’t go well, since that date isn’t (usually) established based on relevant input or estimates. And the cause of failure is that things get worse towards the end due to time pressure resulting in corners getting cut and more errors. This author suggests an approach of developing multiple prototypes (called “value attempts”) to get _**early**_ feedback and to allow the development team to find some good foundation (tools, frameworks, practices, etc.) to build on, _before_ making firm commitments on delivery.
[https://iism.org/article/driving-engineers-to-an-arbitrary-date-is-a-value-destroying-mistake-49](https://iism.org/article/driving-engineers-to-an-arbitrary-date-is-a-value-destroying-mistake-49)

#### Article: A QEMU case study in grappling with software complexity
All software has intrinsic complexity, by its very nature. Typically, we divide this complexity into two categories: “essential” and “accidental” complexity. Most often, we would like to _eliminate_ “accidental” complexity and _reduce_ “essential” complexity. In this article, [Paolo Bonzini](https://mobile.twitter.com/fagiolinux?lang=en), one of the maintainers of the [QEMU](https://qemu.org/) open-source emulator and virtualization tool, uses real-life examples of both types of complexity from the project to show how to manage complexity on a project that itself is quite complex.

Article: What the Four Color Theorem Can Teach Us About Writing Software

You’ve probably heard of the [four-color map theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42-ws3bkrKM) which basically proves that any map needs at most 4 colors so that any adjacent regions do not have the same color. This author takes the more fundamental aspect of the theorem about graphs to show that

The skills and responsibilities of managers are [much different](https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/should-engineering-managers-write-code-wrong-question-ec5fc54d3903) than those of developers. This author provides eight tips on how to successfully tackle the challenge.

#### Article: Give Me Back My Monolith

Peak oil? Peak car? In a similar vein as the previous article, this article says that we’ve reached "peak microservices" and the pendulum is swinging back toward integrated platforms. His concerns with microservices include configuration complexity, version management, and ability to debug and test.

#### Article: The Daily Scrum is a Planning Meeting... Not a Status Meeting

Most scrum teams that I’ve been part of focus on the status reporting aspect of the daily meeting. This author emphasizes that while status updates are part of the meeting, they only provide context for planning work for the next day. For example, to communicate dependencies, request help if someone is stuck on a problem, etc.

#### Article: A Wake-Up Call For Tech Managers

What do you think is the most important skill for a manager? Understanding finances and business strategy? Perhaps having good technical skills to understand the work of their employees? This author says that listening is far and away the most important skill. And not just listening sympathetically, but acting on the input for team improvement.

#### Article: You Are Not Google

Of course, software architecture is both important and valuable. But you are also _primarily_ responsible for building and delivering business value (i.e., "working software"!) to your customers. This author emphasizes that most (in fact, almost all) organizations do not have the needs or means for engineering scale of the Google’s, Facebook’s and other similar organizations of the world and, therefore, should concentrate on their domain of expertise: their own business! And if your business does grow large, then you will certainly have the resources necessary to scale appropriately.

#### Article: Agile Lite: Agile without all the burnout

If you have been involved with "agile" (so-called "small A" agile) development since it’s beginning (yes, I have!), you likely remember its promise to remove so much of the administrative burden from team members. Well, by now, most of us know that the reality is quite different. This author proposes some excellent adaptations to help alleviate many of the soul-crushing aspects of the ("big A") agile practices.

#### Article: No, You Don’t Need a Blockchain

The [hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) is a powerful force in software development and the blockchain seems to be the latest technology swept up in it. The blockchain, like any technology, is simply a tool and you need to understand whether it applies to the work you are doing. This article explains how most current development does not need a blockchain. And if you’re still not sure after reading this article, check out this [interactive flow chart](https://brucemacd.github.io/You-Dont-Need-A-Blockchain/) to help you decide.

#### Article: Software Methodology: Why One Size Fits No One

You’ve likely heard how this or that (Scrum, Extreme Programming, Kanban, Lean, etc.) is the "one true path" to software development and project management ecstasy. Since no organization is the same as another, no one methodology or implementation can be right for everyone. This article takes the risk-based perspective to help you choose a process/methodology that makes sense for your situation.

#### Article: When and why to clean up your code: now, later, never

We hear a lot about technical debt and, mostly, the implication is that it’s bad. One aspect of technical debt is code cleanliness. This article explains why "dirty" code is a problem and how to evaluate when you should address this, if ever.

#### Article: The Employee Engagement Myth

"Employee engagement" is a common buzzword in management circles and you’ve probably heard it in your workplace. This development manager looks at several of the problems and fallacies, including the classic "correlation does not imply causation" when it comes to programs to improve engagement and the key point that engagement itself does not drive productivity, but precisely the other way around: workers who do meaningful work are inherently engaged and productive.

#### Article: Do We Worship Complexity?

Whether you have formal/rigorous software architecture practices in your organization, at the core of all worth that you do you should strive for simplicity. So why do we so often end up with systems with excessive complexity? This author suggests that poor communication lies at the heart of the problem and that the software architect’s key job is to ensure that complexity is driven out at every opportunity.

#### Article: Why Software Development Requires Servant Leaders

"Servant leadership" has a strong foundation in many domains, especially religion, but it hasn’t taken root in software development. This author explains how its principles apply specifically to programming, since it is a field that requires both independence and collaboration.

#### Article: Stop future-proofing software

Most developers know the maxim that the best code is code that is never written. This developer makes a strong case for avoiding implementing speculative functionality to support unknown future features. He says that proving out the importance of a feature is significantly more critical than ensuring future scalability.

#### Video: Can We Just Stop Pretending Planning Software Development Can Be "Certain"?

Perhaps you’ve had the experience where one of your estimates on implementing a feature turned into a commitment to deliver it in that amount of time. In this brief video, agile coach [Jamye Edwards](https://twitter.com/jaymeedwards) says that we should stop acting like software development is a highly-predictable endeavor and instead emphasize reasonable windows of time with likelihood estimates.

#### Article: How To Use Technical Debt In Your Favor

Usually, we hear about technical debt in a negative context. This author explains that, just like with financial debt, sometimes technical debt can be used as an advantage to deliver functionality more quickly. The key to managing it is to not overextend yourself (just like in real life!).

#### Article: Perfect code is an illusion

In keeping with one of our principles that practicality is a prime virtue, this article dispels the idea that we should (or even can!) aim for perfect code. The author notes that most code is only read by a few other people, so the main objective is for it to be understandable. Moreover, he claims that this concept also helps reduce conflict on teams by allowing creativity and personal preferences to shine through.

#### Article: Software Estimation in the Fractal Dimension

Many developers dread estimating task effort/duration. This article examines estimation from the perspective that as the granularity of detail that we have about a given task (or feature, user story, etc.), our estimates tend to be better, but they also tend to be longer than the original estimate. The upshot of this is that we need to [drive out unnecessary complexity](https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/one-bite-at-a-time-partitioning-complexity/1716882961677894/) in our work to ensure that our estimates can be as accurate as possible.

## Software Testing & Quality

#### Article: Common Misconceptions About Exploratory Testing

Exploratory testing is, at once, one of the most challenging and simple types of testing. However, many people, especially outside of testing, have the notion that it is unstructured and ad hoc. This article debunks several of the common misunderstandings about this important testing approach.

#### Article: A Complete Guide to Negative Testing in Software Testing

In software testing, we typically focus on verification and validation of application functionality and performance. However, it’s also important to perform so-called “negative” tests to ensure that the system doesn’t do things that we don’t intend, as well. This article looks at several aspects of negative testing and provides a nice framework for how to include it in your testing regime.

Apple has recently faced several high-profile software problems, such as the [substantial memory leak in the new macOS Monterey](https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/15/montereys-memory-leak-and-how-to-avoid-it/). But many pundits and insiders think <font color="#000000"><font style="font-size: 10pt" size="2"><span lang="en-US">that</span></font></font> poor quality software has become endemic and is beginning to overshadow the technological improvements the company makes. Perhaps this should be a cautionary tale to all organizations about the value and importance of software quality.

When you spend $3 billion on a top-of-the-line warship, you (as a taxpayer) would expect it to have the best navigation software in the world, wouldn’t you? Unfortunately, the US Navy [Seawolf-class submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawolf-class_submarine) have software far less sophisticated than what you have on your phone. And this led to a [recent accident involving the USS Connecticut](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/asia/submarine-uss-connecticut-accident-undersea-mountain-hnk-intl-ml-dst/index.html), in which the submarine attempted to dive below the level of the sea floor due (at least in part) to defective software.

#### Article: Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills
Technical interviewing often strikes fear in the heart of job candidates. Recent research shows that whiteboard interviews provide little in the way of assessment of technical skill and job fit and, instead, mostly measures the candidate’s anxiety. Moreover, researchers found that interviewers often demonstrated subtle bias in the such was as giving easier problems to preferred candidates.

#### Article: I have no idea what I’m doing
Authenticity is the fundamental value of the millennial generation (or so I’m told). The technology industry is going through the growing pains of transition from one dominated by Baby Boomers and Gen X to Millennials and one of the latest fronts appears to be with respect to disclosure about one’s own shortcomings. This article and the others cited in it show how development changes so quickly that even the most skilled have difficulty keeping up and that perhaps everyone needs to extend some mercy and grace to others instead of questioning their motives or, even worse, fundamental abilities. The better choice is to come along side and provide help and support.

#### Article: The Chip That Changed the World
To little fanfare, in November 1971, Intel introduced the first _**commercial**_ microprocessor: the 2300-transistor, 4-bit [4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004). It was the beginning of a revolution in technology unlike the world has ever seen and became the driver for the generation of most of the world’s wealth over the past 50 years.

#### Article: Accountability in Software Development
One of the hallmarks of professional practices is accountability. In this essay, Kent Beck, pioneer of [“extreme programming”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), explains how personal accountability is fundamental to successful development work. In particular, he explores how the day-to-day tools, such as estimates (when used properly!), TDD and unit tests, and continuous integration, that we use are visible ways of demonstrating accountability to our teammates and stakeholders.

Article: Why do we buy into the 'cult' of overwork?

Why are so many of our industrial “heroes” people who build cultures of relentless toil?

Article: Why Doesn't Software Show Up in Productivity?

U.S. productivity skyrocketed during the post-World War II period due to a variety of factors and computerization in the 1990s and early 2000s accounts for some of that growth. But since then, productivity growth has essentially stalled, even as software has made use more efficient. What’s behind this paradox?

#### Article: For programmers, remote working is becoming the norm

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, developers and programmers were well on their way toward the remote work future with the proportion working remotely up from ~20% in 2017 to more than 30% by the beginning of 2020\. Now, fully 3/4 of the tech workforce is remote, even in the face of mounting “return to office” pressure.

#### Article: Programming: doing it more versus doing it better

One of the classic conundrums in development management is how to measure developer productivity and quality. Should you count lines of code? Or defects fixed?

#### Article: Don’t learn a programming language, solve a problem instead

You’ve probably seen the blog posts about "What programming language should I learn?" This author makes an excellent observation that rather than focusing on a language, you should find a problem that interests you and work on a solution. If you choose to use a new language, that’s fine, but it’s not the impetus of the approach, since "scratching your own itch" will usually provide more motivation.

Discussion: Please [Do] Don't Learn to Code

Jeff Atwood ignited a firestorm of impassioned responses with his criticism of the [Code Year](http://codeyear.com/) project's attempt to teach anyone how to develop, saying that not everyone needs to know how to program, just like everyone doesn't [need to be able to do plumbing](http://toiletcademy.com/). Here is the original article and a selection of thoughtful responses. (Of course, this certainly does not include all of the responses!

## PLOM (Programming Language of the Month)

#### Coconut

Coconut is a functional programming language that compiles to Python. Any valid Python program is also a valid Coconut program, so it provides a gentle transition to functional programming for the Python developer. Its stated goal is to be simple, elegant, and Pythonic and its syntax is similar to Haskell. Some of the most salient features include more natural lambda functions, pipeline-style programming, (pre-Python 3.10) native pattern matching, function composition, lazy lists, and [algebraic data types](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/algebraic-data-types-what-i-wish-someone-had-explained-about-functional-programming/). You can get a taste for it in the REPL on the language [home page](https://coconut-lang.org/) or [read the tutorial](https://coconut.readthedocs.io/).

#### CPC 472: The Computer with Non-Functional RAM
In the 1980s, Amstrad sold a "customized" version of their standard CPC 464 computer, which came with (a whopping!) 64KB of RAM, with an extra 8KB of RAM soldered onto the board. The odd part was that the 8KB RAM chip wasn't connected to anything else and only existed to circumvent a steep Spanish import tariff on computers with 64KB or less of RAM!

#### The Supersonic Trebuchet

First of all, I never would have even thought of such a thing. And, even if I had, I’d never have imagined that it was even possible! But this guy designed and built a traditional [trebuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet) that can launch projectiles at more than 450 m/s! Watch the video and be amazed.

#### First Ever Life-Size and Drivable LEGO® Technic Bugatti Chiron Is A Pioneering Piece of Engineering and Design

To celebrate the introduction of their new nearly 1500-hp, 250-mph [Chiron](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2018-bugatti-chiron-review/) model, Bugatti commissioned LEGO to build a replica using the classic toy. The result is an amazing and beautiful full-size replica with over 1 million pieces from over 300 different LEGO Technic piece types that took more than 13000 hours to build. But you probably won’t want to build one at home, as the 2300+ [LEGO motors](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Power-Functions-Motor-Set-8293) that power the model _alone_ would cost almost $70000 retail. But that’s still quite a bit less than the $3 million sticker price for the real thing!
