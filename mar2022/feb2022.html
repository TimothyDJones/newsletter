<h3 class="section-heading">Quotable Quotes</h3>

    <p>While friendship has been by far the chief source of my happiness, acquaintance or general society has always meant little to me, and I cannot quite understand why a man should wish to know more people than he can make real friends of. –C. S. Lewis, <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Surprised_by_Joy.html?id=9hWKm2sFV2gC"><em>Surprised by Joy</em></a></p>

    <p>Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify! –Henry David Thoreau</p>

    <p>Thinking doesn't guarantee that we won't make mistakes. But not thinking guarantees that we will. –Leslie Lamport, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/">"Why We Should Build Software Like We Build Houses"</a></p>

    <p>The formation of hypotheses is the most mysterious of all the categories of scientific method. Where they come from, no one knows. A person is sitting somewhere, minding his own business, and suddenly - flash! - he understands something he didn't understand before. Until it's tested the hypothesis isn't truth. For the tests aren't its source. Its source is somewhere else. –Robert Pirsig, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gx2ev_vwGKAC"><em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em></a> (1974)</p>

    <p>The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system. –Robert C. "Uncle Bob" Martin, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uGE1DwAAQBAJ"><em>Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design</em></a></p>

    <h4>Article: Complexity is killing software developers</h4>
    <p class="indent">One of the open secrets in the development world is the exponential growth of complexity of applications, platforms, and systems. In most cases, it is difficult, if not almost impossible, for programmers to have a strong understanding of their systems' architectures. This article claims that the rise of APIs (cloud, serverless, etc.) has pushed teams toward excessive “accidental” complexity. Likewise, large organizations make communication more challenging. The basic upshot of the article is that providers of services need to have more empathy for their consumers, whether they are internal or external to allow simplification at as many levels as possible.</p>

    <h4>Article: Why Agile rarely works in the Enterprise</h4>
    <p class="indent">Today, agile development methods are the norm in most organizations. No one wants to say that their team isn't agile! However, in large organizations, agile (often the “big A” agile sold by many consultancies) efforts fall far short of their goals and frequently end up as “waterfall with stand ups”. This article looks at several of the pitfalls and some concrete suggestions for how to fix these problems. How many of these do you recognize in your own organization or team?</p>
    <p class="indent"><a href="https://medium.com/@gramr/why-agile-rarely-works-in-the-enterprise-816561515549">https://medium.com/@gramr/why-agile-rarely-works-in-the-enterprise-816561515549</a></p>

    <h4>Article: Great engineering teams focus on milestones instead of projects</h4>
    <p class="indent">Why do some teams just seem to perform better than others? This author says that teams that emphasize accomplishing clear, well-defined milestones that provide some specific business value. This allows the team to adapt more easily and for the team to break the project into more manageable "chunks" of work. In turn, both the project team and customers can see measurable progress toward the larger goal.</p>

    <h4>Article: Don't start with microservices – monoliths are your friend</h4>
    <p class="indent">Doubtless, this article is destined to inspire controversy. Nevertheless, the author makes several strong points in favor of introducing microservices later in the lifecycle of your project, after you've stabilized the overall architecture and identified the places where they make sense. To be sure, he is not anti-microservices; instead, he simply advocates taking a balanced approach to how they are used.</p>

    <h4>Article: Agile is Dead, McKinsey Just Killed It</h4>
    <p class="indent">In a <em>very</em> similar vein to the article above, this article shows how the adoption of “enterprise agile”, especially as provided by consultancies, such as McKinsey in this case, have essentially left the whole agile concept often without meaning. The article discusses how McKinsey touts their offering of overarching management of the agile process and organization, which is the antithesis of principles of the Agile Manifesto.</p>

    <h4>Article: Writing Maintainable Code Is a Communication Skill</h4>
    <p class="indent">You may remember early in your career that you focused on delivering your application above all else. As you gained experience, you started to understand that so much else matters, including maintainability. This author explains that maintainability is primarily the skill of communicating both your intent and any trade-offs or special constraints that you had to take into account.</p>

    <h4>Article: Tasking developers with creating detailed estimates is a waste of time/money</h4>
    <p class="indent">Many of you have probably heard of the so-called <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%23noestimates+movement&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=web">#NoEstimates “movement”</a> in the software development milieu. This article, however, is not against estimates, but rather against having developers spend time trying to do <strong>detailed</strong> estimation on work that inevitably requires much additional discovery to complete successfully. The author emphasizes that estimates should be based on accurate historical data for similar efforts (size, complexity, technology, team, etc.) and, most importantly, that the overall estimate is <strong>not</strong> a definitive completion date for the project.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Software Testing &amp; Quality</h3>
<p><br/> </p>

    <h4>Article: Common Misconceptions About Exploratory Testing</h4>
    <p class="indent">Exploratory testing is, at once, one of the most challenging and simple types of testing. However, many people, especially outside of testing, have the notion that it is unstructured and ad hoc. This article debunks several of the common misunderstandings about this important testing approach.</p>

    <h4>Article: A Complete Guide to Negative Testing in Software Testing</h4>
    <p class="indent">In software testing, we typically focus on verification and validation of application functionality and performance. However, it's also important to perform so-called “negative” tests to ensure that the system doesn't do things that we don't intend, as well. This article looks at several aspects of negative testing and provides a nice framework for how to include it in your testing regime.</p>

    <h4>Article: If Apple keeps letting its software slip, the next big thing won’t matter</h4>
    <p class="indent">Apple has recently faced several high-profile software problems, such as the <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/15/montereys-memory-leak-and-how-to-avoid-it/">substantial memory leak in the new macOS Monterey</a>. But many pundits and insiders think that poor quality software has become endemic and is beginning to overshadow the technological improvements the company makes. Perhaps this should be a cautionary tale to all organizations about the value and importance of software quality.</p>

    <h4>Article: A Submarine's Weakness: Its Software?</h4>
    <p class="indent">When you spend $3 billion on a top-of-the-line warship, you (as a taxpayer) would expect it to have the best navigation software in the world, wouldn't you? Unfortunately, the US Navy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawolf-class_submarine">Seawolf-class submarines</a> have software far less sophisticated than what you have on your phone. And this led to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/04/asia/submarine-uss-connecticut-accident-undersea-mountain-hnk-intl-ml-dst/index.html">recent accident involving the USS Connecticut</a>, in which the submarine attempted to dive below the level of the sea floor due (at least in part) to defective software.</p>

    <h4>Tutorial: Anatomy of a Terminal Emulator</h4>
    <p class="indent">Even with the entrenchment of GUIs, the command line remains a ubiquitous tool for most developers and, therefore, terminal emulators and related tools are probably second only to text editors when it comes to programmer's passions. But how do they actually work? Perhaps I found this article so intriguing, because my introduction to professional development world was working on the venerable <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datastorm_Technologies">Procomm Plus</a> software. Nevertheless, everyone can benefit from a basic understanding of how they work and this article does a great job, including copious examples of Rust code to demonstrate the concepts.</p>

    <h4>Article: Tech Sector Job Interviews Assess Anxiety, Not Software Skills</h4>
    <p class="indent">Technical interviewing often strikes fear in the heart of job candidates. Recent research shows that whiteboard interviews provide little in the way of assessment of technical skill and job fit and, instead, mostly measures the candidate's anxiety. Moreover, researchers found that interviewers often demonstrated subtle bias in the such was as giving easier problems to preferred candidates.</p>

    <h4>Article: I have no idea what I'm doing</h4>
    <p class="indent">Authenticity is the fundamental value of the millennial generation (or so I'm told). The technology industry is going through the growing pains of transition from one dominated by Baby Boomers and Gen X to Millennials and one of the latest fronts appears to be with respect to disclosure about one's own shortcomings. This article and the others cited in it show how development changes so quickly that even the most skilled have difficulty keeping up and that perhaps everyone needs to extend some mercy and grace to others instead of questioning their motives or, even worse, fundamental abilities. The better choice is to come along side and provide help and support.</p>

    <h4>Article: Accountability in Software Development</h4>
    <p class="indent">One of the hallmarks of professional practices is accountability. In this essay, Kent Beck, pioneer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">"extreme programming"</a>, explains how personal accountability is fundamental to successful development work. In particular, he explores how the day-to-day tools, such as estimates (when used properly!), TDD and unit tests, and continuous integration, that we use are visible ways of demonstrating accountability to our teammates and stakeholders.</p>
